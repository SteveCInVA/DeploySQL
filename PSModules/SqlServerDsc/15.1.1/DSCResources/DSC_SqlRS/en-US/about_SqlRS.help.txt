.NAME
    SqlRS

.DESCRIPTION
    The SqlRS DSC resource initializes and configures SQL Reporting Services
    server.

    ## Requirements

    * Target machine must be running Windows Server 2012 or later.
    * Target machine must be running SQL Server Reporting Services 20012 or later.
    * To use parameter UseSSL target machine must be running SQL Server Reporting
      Services 2012 or later.
    * If PsDscRunAsCredential common parameter is used to run the resource, the
      specified credential must have permissions to connect to the SQL Server instance
      specified in DatabaseServerName and DatabaseInstanceName, and have permission
      to create the Reporting Services databases.

    ## Known issues

    * This resource does not currently have full SSL support, please see
      https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/587 for more
      information.

    All issues are not listed here, see https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+in%3Atitle+SqlRS.

    ## Known error messages

    ### Error: The parameter is incorrect (HRESULT:-2147024809)

    This is caused by trying to add an URL with the wrong format
    i.e. 'htp://+:80'.

    ### Error: The Url has already been reserved (HRESULT:-2147220932)

    This is caused when the URL is already reserved. For example when 'http://+:80'
    already exist.

    ### Error: Cannot create a file when that file already exists (HRESULT:-2147024713)

    This is caused when trying to add another URL using the same protocol. For example
    when trying to add 'http://+:443' when 'http://+:80' already exist.

.PARAMETER UseSsl
    Write - Boolean
    If connections to the Reporting Services must use SSL. If this parameter is not assigned a value, the default is that Reporting Services does not use SSL.

.PARAMETER SuppressRestart
    Write - Boolean
    Reporting Services need to be restarted after initialization or settings change. If this parameter is set to $true, Reporting Services will not be restarted, even after initialization.

.PARAMETER IsInitialized
    Read - Boolean

.EXAMPLE 1

This example performs a default SQL Server Reporting Services configuration.
It will initialize SQL Server Reporting Services and register default
Report Server Web Service and Report Manager URLs.

Report Server Web Service: http://localhost:80/ReportServer
Report Manager: http://localhost:80/Reports

Configuration Example
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'SqlServerDsc'

    node localhost
    {
        SqlRS 'DefaultConfiguration'
        {
            InstanceName         = 'MSSQLSERVER'
            DatabaseServerName   = 'localhost'
            DatabaseInstanceName = 'MSSQLSERVER'
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 2

This example performs a custom SQL Server Reporting Services configuration.
It will initialize SQL Server Reporting Services and register the below
custom Report Server Web Service and Report Manager URLs.

Report Server Web Service:
http://localhost:80/MyReportServer
https://localhost:443/MyReportServer

Report Manager:
http://localhost:80/MyReports
https://localhost:443/MyReports

Note: this resource does not currently handle SSL bindings for HTTPS endpoints.

Configuration Example
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'SqlServerDsc'

    node localhost
    {
        SqlRS 'DefaultConfiguration'
        {
            InstanceName                 = 'MSSQLSERVER'
            DatabaseServerName           = 'localhost'
            DatabaseInstanceName         = 'MSSQLSERVER'
            ReportServerVirtualDirectory = 'MyReportServer'
            ReportsVirtualDirectory      = 'MyReports'
            ReportServerReservedUrl      = @('http://+:80', 'https://+:443')
            ReportsReservedUrl           = @('http://+:80', 'https://+:443')
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 3

This example performs a custom SQL Server Reporting Services configuration.
It will initialize SQL Server Reporting Services and register the below
custom Report Server Web Service and Report Manager URLs and enable SSL.

Report Server Web Service: https://localhost:443/MyReportServer ()
Report Manager: https://localhost:443/MyReports

Note: this resource does not currently handle SSL bindings for HTTPS endpoints.

Configuration Example
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName 'SqlServerDsc'

    node localhost
    {
        SqlRS 'DefaultConfiguration'
        {
            InstanceName                 = 'MSSQLSERVER'
            DatabaseServerName           = 'localhost'
            DatabaseInstanceName         = 'MSSQLSERVER'
            ReportServerVirtualDirectory = 'MyReportServer'
            ReportsVirtualDirectory      = 'MyReports'
            ReportServerReservedUrl      = @('https://+:443')
            ReportsReservedUrl           = @('https://+:443')
            UseSsl                       = $true
        }
    }
}

.EXAMPLE 4

This example installs to instances where the first named instance is used for
the Reporting Services databases, and the second named instance is used for
Reporting Services. After installing the two instances, the configuration
performs a default SQL Server Reporting Services configuration. It will
initialize SQL Server Reporting Services and register the default
Report Server Web Service and Report Manager URLs:

Report Manager: http://localhost:80/Reports_RS
Report Server Web Service: http://localhost:80/ReportServer_RS
