LONG DESCRIPTION
	Welcome to the dbatools help central.
	This guide tries to show you how to best get help.
	
	Over the project's lifetime, dbatools has grown explosively and many
	features were added to cope with the sheer scale of this project. Thus,
	dbatools has become highly complex as far as a PowerShell module goes. With
	great complexity comes a great need for documentation.
	Which is where this article comes in.

	When designing the way the module is imported, we had to make several trade-
	offs. Not every decision we made is always the right way for everybody
	however, so we set up some options that let you decide, which way you
	prefer. Basically, we had to balance import time vs. security policies and
	resource cost. This guide explains what the settings do and how to set them:
